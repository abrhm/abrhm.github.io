  <h1>Welcome to The Meta Blog!</h1>
  <pre>
    Greetings Wanderer and welcome to this blog.
    What the f** is this? You may ask.
    Well to explain this I first have to introduce myself.
    My name is Gábor Ábrahám and I'm working as a software engineer for almost a decade now.
    As you can see I'm not a native english speaker (or writer in my case).
    Also I'm (trying to be) funny.
  </pre>
  <pre>
    So about this blog, I like experimenting with different technologies and stuff so why don't share it?
    The idea is that I'm creating a blog for myself while I'm explaining it how I've created it and why I choose that specific solution.
    Also I really hate when there is an example in the internet with a code snippet, but parts are missing. (I get it it would be long, but please create an example repository!)
    My other goal is to improve my english, so feel free to correct me by opening an issue on <a href="https://github.com/abrhm/abrhm.github.io/issues" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
    Today we are going to "release" 2 version of this blog so don't waste any more time.
  </pre>
  <h2>The Code</h2>
  <h3><a href="./v0/index.html" target="_blank">v0</a></h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a new folder and name it something e.g. <b>meta-blog</b></li>
    <li>Now we would like to track changes and previous versions so use git with <b>git init</b></li>
    <li>I chose github to host this fancy blog, you can do that by creating a repository with a name {github_user_name}.github.io so in my case <a href="https://github.com/abrhm/abrhm.github.io" target="_blank">abrhm.github.io</a></li>
    <li>I've created an empty index.html file and generated its content using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VSCode</a> autocomplete with a single "!" cool!</li>
    <li>Add the file to the version control and push and it is working! (sort of)</li>
  </ol>
  <pre>
    So let's check what we generated with VSCode <a href="https://github.com/abrhm/abrhm.github.io/blob/master/v0/index.html" target="_blank">GitHub</a>:
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;         // We would like to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML5" target="_blank">HTML5</a>
    &lt;html lang="en"&gt;        // We are using english language
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;  // We are using UTF-8 characters
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
    Whoa whoa, this is my first stop this I bet half of the developers or even more don't understand what this means (including me)
    So let's break it up
    We are setting the viewport (how the website will look like)
    The content (which you are seeing) should be
    width=device-width  // As wide as possible by the device and
    initial-scale=1.0   // The initial scale is 1.0 but it can be further zoomed
    To be honest I've tried to play around with the initial-scale but there were no effect.
    Also there are some other interesting things like interactive-widget which you can play around with.
    Nice, lets check some real code.
  </pre>
  <h3>v1</h3>
  <pre>
    Ohh yes the current version, the latest and greatest!
  </pre>
  <pre>
    Well first of all the title is changed to "The Meta Blog" which is looking much better in the browser tab.
    Also we have some nice headings &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt; and so on to structure the content better.
    The &lt;pre&gt; tags are displaying the content as it is, so they have a small padding from the left since I've add a few tabs (spaces).
    Long text looks silly in Full HD monitors.
    We also added a few &lt;a&gt; tag for navigation right now I'm using them as external links, the text inside the tags are going to be a link.
    Also as you can see most of my links are have target="_blank" attributes which is opening the link in a new tab by default.
    I'm using &lt;ol&gt; to have a list with numbers where every &lt;li&gt; element get a number automatically from the browser.
    Then I've starting to refer to my previous code and the madness is starting.
    Since HTML can't know if you write a tag you would like to show it as a text or actually use a tag,
    you have to escape the &lt; and &gt; characters by using &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;.
    Oh and also to be able to write &amp;lt; I have to escape the & so it is going to be:
    &amp;amp;lt; and &amp;amp;gt;
    To be able to escape that you have to...
    Okay I think you get the point, never go full retard!
    Ohh and one last but very important thing, to be able to see the v0 version of this page I moved the previous index.html file to a v0 folder.
    I'm not sure if it is going to work, we will see. :)
  </pre>
  <h2>The Plans</h2>
  <pre>
    So this was huge, my plan for the next change is to add a button somewhere (maybe at the bottom of the page), which is always going to point to the previous "episode".
    I told you long texts looks stupid...
