  <h1>Welcome to The Meta Meta Blog!</h1>

    <a href="../v1/index.html">&lt; Previous version</a>
  </nav>
  <pre>
    Yeah you read it right, since we are referring and improving on "The Meta Blog" it is making this blog the "The Meta Meta Blog"!
    Don't worry I'm not going to rename everything with each modification,
    the idea was to name this blog The Meta Meta Blog from the beginning.
    But let's check code!
  </pre>
  <h2>Previously on The Meta Meta Blog</h2>
  <i>...my plan for the next change is to add a button somewhere (maybe at the bottom of the page), which is always going to point to the previous "episode"</i>
  <h2>The Code</h2>
  <pre>
    So there is nothing special, I moved the previous v1 version to a folder and created a copy and removed most of the things.
    There is a very cool element called &lt;nav&gt; which is used for marking the part of the document as a navigation section.
    I didn't see any huge gain, other than helping disabled people reading software, but hey if you reading this blog maybe nav is also helpful to you. :)
    Too soon? Too dark? Sorry!
    Anyway I just copy/paste the nav section to the top and the bottom.
    I used italic font &lt;i&gt; to mark the quote from my previous version.
    Oh one final trick, you can also use a tag with emails like this &lt;a href="mailto:askmetametablog@gmail.com"&gt;
    which is going to open with the default email client.
    Also I've add git tags so you can check the previous versions more easily.
  </pre>
  <h2>The Plans</h2>
  <pre>
    How about the contacts?
    Also maybe we should redesign the page so it is not looking like it is from the 90s.
    It is going to be a long road, but the goal is to learn and practice! :)
