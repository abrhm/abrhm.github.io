  <h1>Welcome to The Meta Meta Blog!</h1>

    <a href="../v2/index.html">&lt; Previous version</a>

  <h2>Previously on The Meta Meta Blog</h2>
  <i>Also maybe we should redesign the page so it is not looking like it is from the 90s.</i>
  <pre>
    Well seems like plans are changing.
    As usual a critical bug was introduced to the system, so we should fix it first.
    If you check the <a href="../v1/index.html">v1</a> version and click on the v0 link it is not navigating to the proper page.
    Why?
    Well the answer is simple, because we are working with relative links and since we moved the v1 version to a folder, it is no longer working.
    This example is highlighting a very import skill foresight.
    So how to fix that?
    Well since we are planning to improve this blog in a long term we should consider a few changes.
  </pre>
  <h2>The problems</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Creating folders and moving the previous index.html is just not very efficient</li>
    <li>We either not fix the broken v1 page or the v1 git tag is going to be broken from now on</li>
    <li>We have big plans so maybe we should have a room for further improvements, you know #foresight</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>The Code</h2>
  <pre>
    So first of all I'm going to create a new folder <b>public</b> it is going to contain all the public facing sites from now on.
    This is going to be useful in the future if we going to have another folders in this repository.
    Under that folder every blog "entry" going to be a new folder like v0, v1, v2 and this one, the v3.
    Now the problem is that we must have an index.html in the root folder, since it is going to be the main root (where the user navigated first).
    Luckily HTML have a solution for us called redirecting
  
    In the head just write:
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL=./public/v3/index.html"&gt;
      ...
      &lt;/head&gt;
    The 0 means wait 0 seconds, and after that we can provide an URL, which is always going to be the latest version.
    And tadaohh shit, some weird rooting issue...
    Also the previous link is not working.
    This feature was so young to be broken...
    Well it turned out that this redirect does not like relative paths, so just use https://abrhm.github.io//public/v3/index.html
    as the URL, but than I couldn't try out in my computer. (You know just the everyday struggle of software engineering).
    I also made a nice comment to the body, just in case, but you cannot see it :)
    Okay focus now, most of the things working locally, which is cool let's fix the git tags.
  
    To be able to do that we are going to use semantic versioning.
    What is that?
    Basically it is used to track version numbers like this x.y.z. where:
    x is the MAJOR version, if this is increased from 1 to 2 you are going to have a bad luck
    it means the second version have some breaking changes and there is no guarantee that it is going to work.
    y is the MINOR version officially it is meaning that you can safely update between these versions everything should work fine,
    but if there is one thing I learned, I would say "We hope it is not going to break anything"
    z is the PATCH version, officially this is for bugfixes, or I would say "Most probably we are not going to break anything".

    So in our case we are going to use the PATCH version, since most probably it is going to work.
    Luckily v0 is not affected since it is not doing anything useful (good old v0 how stable...)
    So we are going to tag the v1 version with v1.0.0 and this commit with v1.0.1 also we are going to move v1 to v1.0.1.
    So:
    In case of v1.0.0 the user going to see the original version.
    In case of v1.0.1 the user can see the fixed version.
    In case of v1 the user can see the latest patched version.
    Also I have to do the same with v2.
    So I guess this is it for today, wish me luck and see you in the other side...

  <h2>The Plans</h2>
  <pre>
    Well plans are not changing much, except 1 thing, did you read the blog in phone?
    Omg it is looks ugly...
    I think we should prioritize that issue, and after continue with the previous items which were:
    How about the contacts?
    Also maybe we should redesign the page so it is not looking like it is from the 90s.
    It is going to be a long road, but the goal is to learn and practice! :)
